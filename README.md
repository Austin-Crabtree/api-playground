# api-playground
This is a playground application for messing with creating a RESTFUL API in golang

To build and run: 
- Download go from [Go](https://golang.org/)
- from cmd prompt or powershell in the repo directory run `go run main.go`
- To query API you can use a browser, curl or I use postman to build requests as I am building an API
